The shape of the eigenmodes in a closed vessel, and the importance of the free-surface boundary conditions, are discussed. Stability boundaries, wave amplitude, and perturbation characteristic time of decay are measured and found to be in agreement with an amplitude equation derived by symmetry. The measurement of the amplitude equation coefficients explains why the observed transition is always supercritical, and shows the effect of the edge constraint on the dissipation and eigen frequency of the various modes. The fluid surface tension is obtained from the dispersion relation measurement. Several visualization methods in large-aspect-ratio cells are presented.},

	abstract = {An optical method for the measurement of the instantaneous topography of the interface between two transparent ﬂuids, named free-surface synthetic Schlieren (FS-SS), is characterised. This method is based on the analysis of the refracted image of a random dot pattern visualized through the interface. The apparent displacement ﬁeld between the refracted image and a reference image obtained when the surface is ﬂat is determined using a digital image correlation (DIC) algorithm. A numerical integration of this displacement ﬁeld, based on a least square inversion of the gradient operator, is used for the reconstruction of the instantaneous surface height, allowing for an excellent spatial resolution with a low computational cost. The main limitation of the method, namely the ray crossing (caustics) due to strong curvature and/or large surface-pattern distance, is discussed. Validation experiments using a transparent solid model with a wavy surface or plane waves at a water–air interface are presented, and some additional time-resolved measurements of circular waves generated by a water drop impact are discussed.},

Instead of a random dot pattern (as usually employed in SSI), a 2D periodic pattern (such as a checkerboard) is used as a backdrop to the refractive object of interest. The range of validity and accuracy of this “Fast Checkerboard Demodulation” (FCD) method are assessed using both synthetic data and experimental recordings of patterns optically distorted by small waves on a water surface. It is found that the FCD method is at least as accurate as sophisticated, multi-stage, digital image correlation (DIC) or optical ﬂow (OF) techniques used with random dot patterns, and it is signiﬁcantly faster. Eﬃcient, fully vectorized, implementations of both the FCD and DIC/OF schemes developed for this study are made available as open source Matlab scripts.},

Parallel lines, squares, and hexagons are observed. With viscosity 100 cS, these stable standing-wave patterns do not exhibit strong sidewall effects, and are found in containers of various shapes including an irregular shape. A ‘quasi-pattern’ of twelvefold symmetry, analogous to a two-dimensional quasi-crystal, is observed for some even/odd frequency ratios. Many of the experimental phenomena can be modelled via cubic-order amplitude equations derived from symmetry arguments.},

When the driving amplitude and frequency are chosen to be near the intersection of the stability boundaries of two nearly degenerate modes, we find that they can compete with each other to produce either periodic or chaotic motion on a slow timescale. We utilize digital image-processing methods to determine the time-dependent amplitudes of the competing modes, and local-sampling techniques to study the onset of chaos in some detail. Reconstruction of the attractors in phase space shows that in the chaotic regime the dimension of the attractor is fractional and at least one Lyapunov exponent is positive. The evidence suggests that a theory incorporating four coupled slow variables will be sufficient to account for the mode competition.},

	abstract = {Wave patterns in the Faraday instability have been studied for decades. Besides the rich wave dynamics observed at the interface, Faraday waves hide elusive flow patterns in the bulk – streaming patterns – which have not been studied experimentally. The streaming patterns are responsible for a net circulation in the flow, which is reminiscent of the circulation in convection cells. In this article, we analyse these streaming flows by conducting experiments in a Faraday-wave set-up using particle image velocimetry. To visualise the flows, we perform stroboscopic measurements to both generate trajectory maps and probe the streaming velocity field. We identify three types of patterns and experimentally show that identical Faraday waves can mask streaming patterns that are qualitatively very different. Next, we consider a three-dimensional model for streaming flows in quasi-inviscid fluids, whose key is the complex coupling occurring at all of the viscous boundary layers. This coupling yields modified boundary conditions in a three-dimensional Navier–Stokes formulation of the streaming flow. Numerical simulations based on this framework show reasonably good agreement, both qualitative and quantitative, with the velocity fields of our experiments. The model highlights the relevance of three-dimensional effects in the streaming patterns. Our simulations also reveal that the variety of streaming patterns is deeply linked to the boundary condition at the top interface, which may be strongly affected by the presence of contaminants.},

	abstract = {We report experimental results which show that the particle motion on the surface perturbed by Faraday waves is similar to the fluid motion in 2D turbulence. It supports the inverse energy cascade or the spectral energy transfer from smaller to larger scales. The vertical acceleration ranges from the Faraday instability threshold up to the droplet nucleation threshold where the ripples are a couple of millimeters high. Such a configuration rules out any 2D assumption on the fluid motion. The motion of floaters on the surface of the Faraday waves is essentially three dimensional but its horizontal component shows unexpected analogy with two-dimensional turbulence. The presence of the inverse cascade is detected by measuring frequency spectra of the Lagrangian velocity and confirmed by computing the third moment of the horizontal Eulerian velocity fluctuations. This is a robust phenomenon observed in deep water in a broad range of flow energies and wavelengths. The emergence of such a phenomenology in Faraday waves broadens the applicability of features common to 2D turbulent flows to the context of surface wave phenomena which is prevalent in many systems.},

Thus when a square plate of glass held horizontally was nipped above and below at the centre, and made to vibrate by the application of a violin bow to the middle of one edge, so as to produce the lowest possible sound, sand sprinkled on the plate assumed the form of a diagonal cross; but the light shavings were gathered together at those parts towards the middle of the four portions where the vibrations were most powerful and the excursions of the plate greatest.},
